### Simple Spring 3.2 WebMVC: ###

The intention of the project is to learn:

1. Servlet 3  (xml free)
1. gradle as build tool
1. Jetty 8 Servlet container
1. arquillian jetty gradle plugin
1. spring webmvc xml-free
1. and more (i.e.: spring security)

<em>Status:</em> Currently the project doesn't run because I didn't managed to deploy a xml-free servlet 3 web application using gradle arquillian jetty plugin :((( Still working to address it.
